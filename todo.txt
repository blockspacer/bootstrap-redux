QUESTIONS
------------
- how are we going to handle meta-program debugging
    note: lua_Debug like callback API is probably our best bet

- how to distinguish fixed-length arrays from dynamic arrays
    without hard coding how dynamic arrays work into the compiler itself.

BIG PICTURE

| command-line program (bc) |    a) command-line arguments should support specifying back-end compiler toolchain

TASKS
------------


DONE
------------
- REFACTOR: escaped_string function in transforms needs to be broken out into
    it's own small state machine.

NOTES
------------

"parse": what does this mean?

1. tokenize an input buffer.
    synonyms: tokenizer, scanner, lexer

2. take ordered list of tokens and parse grammatically
