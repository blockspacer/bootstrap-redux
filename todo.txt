QUESTIONS
------------
- how are we going to handle meta-program debugging
    note: lua_Debug like callback API is probably our best bet

- how to distinguish fixed-length arrays from dynamic arrays
    without hard coding how dynamic arrays work into the compiler itself.

TASKS
------------
- FIX: how to handle expression return values for normal loop termination?
        // i: s32;
        // result := while i < 10 {
        //   print("i = {i}\n");
        //   i +:= 1;
        // };

        what is result here?
- FIX: directed_graph_t requires more refactoring to use new collections

DONE
------------
- REFACTOR: escaped_string function in transforms needs to be broken out into
    it's own small state machine.
- FIX(lexer.cpp): hex, octal, binary parsers should convert to number and check
    sign bit.
- FIX: formatters.h needs to check the number_token_t::size to properly
    output numeric values.
- FIX(lexer.cpp): number tokenizers should assert that a non-alpha character follows the number.
    This will prevent situations like: 123myvar: u8 := 1;
- FIX(lexer.cpp): block comments should encode the nesting via the comment_token_t struct
    or similar.
- FIX(lexer.cpp): decimal numbers should properly parse scientific notation
- REFACTOR: introduce our own trie/trie-map structure that allows us to
    explicitly navigate the internal trie nodes instead of having to
    perform string-like "prefix" searches from the root each time.
- FIX: result_t & result_message_t are using std::string, which is creating copies.
        need to refactor to use std::string_view and plumb in strings::pool_t
        to ensure the values are interned.
