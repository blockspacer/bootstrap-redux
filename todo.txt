QUESTIONS
------------
- how are we going to handle meta-program debugging
    note: lua_Debug like callback API is probably our best bet

- how to distinguish fixed-length arrays from dynamic arrays
    without hard coding how dynamic arrays work into the compiler itself.

BIG PICTURE

+---------------------------+  notes:
| command-line program (bc) |    a) command-line arguments should support specifying back-end compiler toolchain
|                           |
|   args ...                |

    |   job scheduler   |    a) number of workers is based on number of physical cores - some overhead count

        |           |        | (tasks processing in workers can put new work onto the scheduler queue)

- single typed-ast, versioned
- ast is converted to C99 for both meta and runtime

TASKS

DONE
------------
- REFACTOR: escaped_string function in transforms needs to be broken out into
    it's own small state machine.
